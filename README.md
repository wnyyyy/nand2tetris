### Project 1: Boolean Logic

From **Nand**, the following gates were built:
- Not
- Not16
- And
- And16
- Or
- Or8Way
- Or16
- Xor
- Mux
- Mux4Way16
- Mux8Way16
- Mux16
- DMux
- DMux4Way
- DMux8Way

Source files include chip .hdl implementations and helper truth table.

### Project 2: Boolean Arithmetic

The **Arithmetic Logic Unit** (ALU) chip was implemented this section, alongside a few other ones:
- Add16
- FullAdder
- HalfAdder
- Inc16

Source files include chip .hdl implementations and helper truth table.
